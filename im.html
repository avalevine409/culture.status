          <h2> I.C.E </h2>
          <li> ICE stands for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security. ICE was created in 2003.</li>
          <li> I is a component of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), primarily responsible for enforcing federal immigration and customs laws.</li>
          <li> Its powers include investigating, apprehending, arresting, detaining, and removing aliens(undocumented immigrants) within the United States. </li>
          <h2> What to do when I.C.E comes</h2>
          <li> <font color="red">Don’t open the door</font>: Instead, ask the agents from inside if they have a warrant. If they say yes, ask them to slip it under the door. You are not obligated to answer any questions. </li>
          <li> <font color="red">Ask for a lawyer:</font>: You have a right to an attorney. If agents attempt to enter your house forcefully, tell them you “do not authorize entry” and ask to speak with a lawyer. </li>
          <li> <font color="red">Remain silent and protect your information</font>: If you are being detained or arrested, exercise your right to remain silent and do not sign anything. Do not give your personal information or provide fingerprints. Do not provide your identification card or your papers. </li>
          <li> <font color="red">Document everything:</font>: You have the right to take videos and pictures. Take notes of the officers’ license plates and badge numbers. Then, report the raid by calling the <a href="https://unitedwedream.org/about/contact/">United We Dream hotline.</a> </li>
