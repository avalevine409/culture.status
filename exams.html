                            As an immigrant, you need to know what schools will accept you based on your situation. You will not be able to apply for financial aid (FAFSA) and might have
                            to compete with international students for the small pool of financial aid available.<br></br>
                            Luckily, if a college recognizes you to be from America, your opportunities open up. Private colleges will offer financial aid for you.
                            There are also sixteen states where you are eligible for in-state tuition for public colleges. A number of these states are able to grant you
                            state-level financial aid.

                            The Hispanic-Serving Institution or HSI program provides funding for colleges or universities that host predominately low-income,
                            Hispanic students. For a college to be a HSI, 25% of the student body has to be Hispanic. The Hispanic Association of Colleges
                            and Universities (HACU) identifies 472 HSI's in America.
